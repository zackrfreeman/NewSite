Green vases have always caught my eye for their **earthy, soothing aesthetic**. At the **Antique Festival of Midland**, I was thrilled to find a variety of them—each with its **own unique charm**.

Ranging from **glass to ceramic**, these vases now sit beautifully in my home, serving as **eye-catching decor pieces**. Whether used to hold **fresh flowers or as standalone decorations**, they bring a sense of **vintage elegance** that enhances any space. This find reminds me why I love antique shopping—it’s always full of wonderful surprises!
